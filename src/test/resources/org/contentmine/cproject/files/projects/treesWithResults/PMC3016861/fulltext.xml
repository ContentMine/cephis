A total of 16,671 <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies belonging to 20 species of 4 subgenera were collected at altitudes of 680 m, 780 m, 880 m and 980 m. The subgenus Sophophora was predominant with 14 species and the subgenus <italic>Drosilopha</italic> was least represented with only a single species. Cluster analysis and constancy methods were used to analyze the species occurrence qualitatively. Altitudinal changes in the population density, and relative abundance of the different species at different seasons were also studied. The diversity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community was assessed by applying the Simpson and Berger-Parker indices. At 680 m the Simpson Index was low at 0.129 and the Berger- Parker index was high at 1.1 at 980 m. Linear regression showed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community was positively correlated with rainfall but not elevation, Furthermore the density of <italic>Drosophila</italic> changed significantly in different seasons (F = 11.20, df 2, 9; P&#x0003c;0.004). The distributional pattern of a species or related group of species was uneven in space and time. <italic>D. malerkotliana</italic> and <italic>D. nasuta</italic> were found at all altitudes and can be considered as dominant species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cluster analysis</kwd><kwd>occurrence constancy method</kwd><kwd>Simpson Index</kwd><kwd>Berger-Parker Index</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family <italic>Drosophilidae</italic> (Diptera) is composed of more than 3,500 described species that occur in a number of ecosystems all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr02">Bachli 1998</xref>). Most genera are found in tropical regions. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus is the most abundant and comprises around 53% of the total species. Many of them are endemic to certain regions and a few are cosmopolitan, dispersed mostly in association with human activity. Studies of Drosophila have contributed to our understanding of principles of basic genetics, molecular biology, population genetics and evolution. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also being used for the study of population fluctuations, as they are highly sensitive to slight environmental modifications that is reflected in the size of the natural population structure and ecology. It is known that changes in temperature and rainfall affect viability, fertility, developmental time and other factors that influence the rate of population growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">Torres and Madi-Ravazzi 2006</xref>). Rainfall and light intensity also have an influence on the supply of resources, principally in relation to the periods of flowering and fruiting of various vegetable resources that provide most of the sites for oviposition and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr06">Brncic et al. 1985</xref>). In addition to above physical factors, biotic factors also influence the diversity and abundance of natural populations of <italic>Drosophila</italic> including intra&#x02014;inter specific relationships, such as population density, population age, distribution, competition and relationship between <italic>Drosophilids</italic> and their hosts and predators. The number of the individuals of a species in a locality is significantly influenced by the presence or absence of another species, especially those that are ecologically related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20">Putman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr03">Begon 1996</xref>). The ability to colonize multiple niches is an indication of the biological success of many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">Torres and Madi-Ravazzi 2006</xref>).</p><p>Thus the presence or absence of a species in an ecological niche, and its richness or abundance in that area is an indicator of both biological and ecological diversity of that ecosystem. In addition to physical and biotic factors, the topography and season also affect the animal distribution. Elevation is one important aspect of topography and one has to look at the animal distribution from that perspective. A few attempts have been made to collect <italic>Drosophila</italic> at different altitudes, but these data are not analyzed with an ecological perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21">Reddy and Krishnamurthy 1977</xref>). Reddy and Krishnamurthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21">1977</xref>) have also said that physical and biotic factors are the sole determinants of animal communities. If that is so elevation and season should not have any influence on animal distribution. In the present studies we propose to verify the effect of elevation and season on <italic>Drosophila</italic> community.</p><p>Furthermore, in the competitive exclusion theory, Gause suggested that two related species competing for the same resources could not co-exist together in the same ecological niche. Laboratory experiments have questioned the validity of the Gause Principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr01">Ayala 1969</xref>). The presence of taxonomically or phylogenetically related species in an ecological niche indicates their coexistence and absence of such related species suggests competitive exclusion. One aim of the present study is to investigate whether taxonomically or phylogenetically related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species co-exist in nature or not.</p><p>The present analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> community was done at different altitudes of Chamundi hill, Mysore (India). It is a small mountain (11&#x02032;36&#x02032; N Latitude and 76&#x02032; 55&#x02032; E) with scrubby forest that was uninhabited about forty years ago with a small temple at the hilltop. However, the hill has become a famous tourist spot of Mysore (Karnataka, India) since about thirty years ago with a small township built at the top with a population of 2,000 and experiences the inflow of many tourists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The altitudinal and seasonal fluctuation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fauna was studied in four different wild localities of Chamundi hill, Mysore. For this purpose monthly collection of flies were made at the altitudes of 680 m, 780 m, 880 m, and 980 m between February 2005 to January 2006. Both bottle trapping and net sweeping methods were used. For bottle trapping, milk bottles of 250 ml capacity containing smashed ripe banana sprayed with yeast were tied to the twigs underneath small bushes at a height of three to five feet above the ground. Five traps each were kept at each altitude. The following day the mouth of each bottle was plugged with cotton and removed from the bushes. The flies that were collected in the bottles were transferred to fresh bottles containing wheat cream agar medium (consisting 100 gm wheat powder, 120 gm raw sugar, 10 gm agar agar, 7 ml propionic acid boiled in 1000 ml water and cooled, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14">Hegde et al, 2001</xref>) as food. Net sweeping was done on naturally rotting fruits if available or on fruits placed beneath shaded areas of the bushes one day before the collection. After each sweep, flies were transferred to the bottles containing fresh food. Five sweeps were made at each place so as to maintain uniformity in collection in each locality. The flies were brought to the laboratory, isolated, identified and sexed. Categorization of the collected <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies was made respective to taxonomic groups by employing several keys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23">Sturtevant 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18">Patterson and Stone 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">Thorckmorton 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr05">Bock 1971</xref>).

The seasonal difference in population densities was studied by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS 10.5. In order to verify the occurrence of a species qualitatively, the occurrence constancy method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr09">Dijoz 1983</xref>) was used. The constancy value (c) was obtained by dividing the number of collections in which one species occurred by the total number of collections, and then multiplying that result by 100. Species with index c &#x02265; 50 were considered constants. Accessory species were those with 25 &#x02264; c &#x0003c; 50. Accidental species had c &#x0003c; 25. Species that occurred in only one area were considered exclusive. Cluster analysis as described by Mateus et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">2006</xref>) and Giri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12">2007</xref>) were used to design, analyze and compare different <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations on the hill. In the cluster study, Euclidean distance was chosen to measure the similarity between different species and Ward's Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12">Giri et al. 2007</xref>) was followed to unite two clusters. A feature of Euclidean distance was that it is a weighted measurement; the higher the absolute value of the variable the higher will be its weight. <italic>Drosophila</italic> communities were analyzed using ecological indices including Simpson Berger-Parker, and Shannon-Wiener (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">Mateus et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between the abundance, richness and diversity of all groups of flies collected throughout the year was assessed by Simpson (D) and Berger-Parker (1/d) indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">Mateus <italic>et al</italic> 2006</xref>). The Shannon-Weiner index was also calculated, but the result was same as the Berger-Parkar index and was not included here.

At 680 m the density was highest and lowest at 980 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). The results indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> community is affected by elevation. Wakahama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30">1962</xref>) has reported similar altitudinal variation in the distribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in Mt.Dakesan in Japan.

Some suggest that higher elevation is congenial and some suggest that lower elevation is congenial. The present study however clearly demonstrates that the altitude and other biotic and abiotic factors such as rain together determine the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community in a given ecosystem. The ecological conditions of Chamundi hill change with changing altitude, the lower altitude is comparatively cooler with lesser rain and dryness. Temperature and rain increase with increasing altitude except on the top of the hill.</p><table-wrap id="t01" position="float"><label>Table 1. </label><caption><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and their numbers collected from the Chamundi hill during 2005&#x02013;2006</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="t01_01"/></table-wrap><p>According to Hegde et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">2000</xref>) the growth and size of the population depend on several environmental factors in addition to genetic structure. Several earlier workers have been able to collect more flies of <italic>D. nasuta</italic> and <italic>D. immigrons</italic> at high altitudes than at low altitudes. These two species belong to the subgenus <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in the present study the authors collected 1,774 individuals of this subgenus at 880 m.</p><p>The fluctuation in population size of <italic>Drosophila</italic> through different seasons reflects the close relationship between population density with wet and dry seasons. Dobzhansky and Pavan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10">1950</xref>) showed that rainfall appears to have a greater influence on the abundance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> than temperature. In our study density was lowest during pre monsoon, which is the hot season, compared to monsoon season when rainfall increases. Population density declined from the middle of post monsoon when cold and dry weather prevail. There are number of factors that may influence the species richness of a community. They may be classified as 1) geographical (e.g. latitude and longitude); 2) environmental (an environment with a greater variety of niches would be able to host a greater variety of species); and 3) biological (the relationships of predation, competition and population density etc). These factors may have important consequences on the number of species in a given ecosystem. The changes in the natural environment caused by the alteration of seasons, would result in the change in relative frequency of different species from season to season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 2</xref>). In tropical areas, especially in Brazil, changes in the environment are caused by the alteration between the dry and rainy seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10">Dobzhansky and Pavan 1950</xref>). It should be emphasized that the months with higher species richness occur during the rainy season. These differences suggest that at different altitudes the capacity to support <italic>Drosophila</italic> species varies. Thus the existence of seasonal variation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> species is quite evident by the presence of greater numbers of species in monsoon compared to pre and post monsoon periods. However, in temperate regions population densities decline to an extremely low level during cold winter months indicating the influence of temperature on the regulation of population size as is true in several <italic>Drosophila</italic> species inhabiting temperate regions (Patterson 1943; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10">Dobzhansky and Pavan 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31">William and Miller 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29">Wakahama 1961</xref>). Thus it is evident that <italic>Drosophila</italic> community structure is affected by physical and biotic factors in addition to physiographic factors.</p><fig id="f03" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3. </label><caption><p>Dendrogram of <italic>Drosophila</italic> analyzed through cluster analysis.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16">Mateus <italic>et al</italic> 2006</xref>). Applying these indices to understand the measures of biodiversity of flies at different altitudes of Chamundi hill demonstrates that the lower altitude of 680 m has a lower value (D) and higher value of 1/d indicating more biodiversity compared to the higher altitude of 980 m (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>). Although, these three indices revealed greater diversity at 680 m, more species were collected at 980 m. The reason for this may be easily understood if we observe the quantity and dominance of each species at each altitude, since the index combines two functions: number of species and uniformity, i.e. the number of individuals presented in each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15">Ludwig and Reynold 1988</xref>; Torres and Madi-Ravazzi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">2006</xref>). Again, this may be correlated to the vegetation and flowering plants at different altitudes. Thus, from the present ecodistributional analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in Chamundi hill it is clear that the distributional pattern of a species or related group of species is uneven in space and time. <italic>D. malerkotliana</italic> and <italic>D. nasuta</italic> could be considered as dominant species, as they are registered in all altitudes with high numbers.</p><table-wrap id="t03" position="float"><label>Table 3. </label><caption><p>Simpson index (D) and Berger-Parker indices (l/d) for Drosophila collected at different altitudes of Chamundi hill.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="t03_01"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="t04" position="float"><label>Table 4. </label><caption><p>Linear regression analysis of temperature, altitude and rainfall.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="t04_01"/></table-wrap></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the Chairman, Department of Studies in Zoology, Manasagangotri, Mysore, India, for facilities and University Grants Commission, New Delhi for Financial support under Departmental Special Assistance Programme.</p></ack><ref-list content-type="parsed"><title>References</title><ref id="bibr01"><element-citation publication-type="journal">
