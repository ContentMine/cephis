However, the development of insecticide resistance and its implications for operational failure of preventative strategies are of concern. The aim of this study was to characterize insecticide resistance among Anopheles arabiensis and 2016. Methods: seasons in study sites from seven of the nine regions in Ethiopia. Insecticide resistance levels were measured with WHO susceptibility tests and CDC bottle bioassays using insecticides from four chemical classes (organochlorines, pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates), with minor variations in insecticides tested and assays conducted between years. In selected sites, CDC synergist assays were performed by pre butoxide (PBO). In 2015 and 2016, mosquitoes from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays were randomly selected, identi fied to species‑level and screened for knockdown resistance ( Results: for IRS and concomitant increases in insecticide‑treated net coverage over the last 15 years. Longitudinal resistance trends to malathion, bendiocarb, propoxur and pirimiphos policy. By 2016, resistance to the latter two insecticides had emerged, with the potential to jeopardize future long term effectiveness of vector control activities in these areas. Between 2015 and 2016, the West African (L1014F) allele was detected in 74.1% (n = 686/926) of specimens, with frequencies ranging from 31 to 100% and 33 to 100% in survivors from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays, respectively. Restoration of mosquito susceptibility, following pre exposure to PBO, along with a lack of association between indicate metabolic and target‑site mutation mechanisms are contributing to insecticide resistance. *Correspondence: ndx1@cdc.gov 1 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30329‑4027, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Insecticide resistance in arabiensis nationwide study for insecticide resistance monitoring</span>

  <span class="columnSpan">Conclusions: resistance management strategy to safeguard continued efficacy of IRS and other malaria control methods in Ethiopia. Keywords:Anopheles arabiensis Despite the scaling-up of key diagnostic, treatment and preventative measures, malaria remains a considerable public health problem in Ethiopia, with over 50.6 million (60% of the total population) at significant risk [ Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum dium vivax the country, concentrated in lowland and highland fringe areas [2]. Unlike other sub-Saharan countries, where malaria morbidity and mortality mainly impacts young children, in Ethiopia, low levels of immunity predispose many individuals to clinically severe malaria and epi demics among all age groups. As part of the National Malaria Strategic Plan (2014–2020), vector control by the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), with support from the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the Global Fund, is based on indoor residual spraying (IRS) and universal coverage campaigns of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) [1–4]. IRS was first implemented in Ethiopia in 1959 and con tinues to play a prominent role in malaria control. LLIN coverage has been scaled up since 2005, resulting in over 64 million nets distributed by 2014 [2]. However, the long-term effectiveness of both strategies is currently under threat from widespread emergence of insecticide resistance in the principal malaria vector, Anopheles ara biensis3]. To date,  iin Ethiopia, An. arabiensis oped resistance against insecticides belonging to all four chemical classes approved for IRS, including DDT (organochlorine), malathion (organophosphate), bendiocarb and propoxur (carbamates) and alpha-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, etofenprox, lambda-cyhalothrin and permethrin (pyrethroids) [5–14]. The West African kdrAn. arabi ensis9, 14, 15] and preexposure of An. arabiensis significantly increased vector susceptibility to deltamethrin and permethrin [12], suggesting both metabolic and target-site mutation mechanisms are responsible for insecticide resistance. Historically, DDT, and to a lesser extent, malathion were used for IRS in Ethiopia [ 2010, vector control by the NMCP, with support from PMI, discontinued DDT spraying in favour of deltame thrin, which was used initially in combination with benBackground</span>

Bioassays were conducted annually during the long rainy season (June–September).

From -2014 onwards, CDC resistance intensity assays were undertaken and synergist assays were also performed by pre-exposing mosquitoes to PBO in selected sites.

  <span class="columnSpan">vector tolerance, may not necessarily be interchangeable [28].Regarding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, the restoration of pyrethroid susceptibility following pre-exposure to PBO and the non-association of L1014F kdrallele frequency with levels of An. arabiensisin WHO bioassays, suggests that both over-expression of detoxification enzymes and target-site mutations are driving insecticide resistance. Moderate to high kdr-quencies were detected in a number of sites and were fixed or approaching fixation in a minority. However, by -comparison with earlier reports from the same areas, kdr9, 14, 47] and between our study years we also observed a slight, albeit not statistically significant, decline. In 2015, the lack of deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in most areas indicated that selection for kdrnot ongoing, allowing this allele to be lost to genetic drift in some populations, but by 2016, study sites from five regions demonstrated evidence for kdr-tially resulting from a mass distribution of LLINs by the NMCP beginning in August 2015. Given the lack of asso-ciation between mosquito bioassay mortality and pres-ence/absence of kdrmechanisms at play in the development of resistance. Future local surveillance programmes may wish to con-sider screening for additional, recently identified genetic markers of metabolic resistance in An. arabiensis, e.g. CYP6P448].-To date, the presence of insensitive acetylcholinesterase Rmutations (ace-1ance to both organophosphates and carbamates in An. ]. Anoph-gambiaeAn. arabiensis49, 50], has not been reported in Ethiopia among vectors resistant to mala-thion or propoxur [9]. The bioassay results in this study were not indicative of any cross-resistance both between organophosphates and carbamates and among chemicals belonging to the same insecticide class. This observation suggests the existence of additional metabolic resistance mechanisms that can confer insecticide-specific resist--ance and also has implications for the development of an insecticide resistance management strategy. If inter- and intra-class rotation of different insecticides could be exploited to reduce selection pressures, this may have the potential to safeguard continued efficacy of IRS and other vector control strategies in Ethiopia and proactively -mitigate the development of future insecticide resistance. ). Furthermore, additional epidemiological studies are war-ranted, in parallel with future resistance monitoring  aactiv-Conclusions</span>
