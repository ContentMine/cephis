Kiuru, Florence Awino Oyieke, Wolfgang Richard Mukabana55* Luna Kamau‑Matoke Abstract Background: been the scale‑up of long‑lasting insecticidal nets to universal coverage and indoor residual spraying. This has led to significant decline in malaria transmission. However, these vector control strategies rely on insecticides which are threatened by insecticide resistance. In this study the status of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors and it tion in malaria transmission at the Kenyan Coast was investigated. Results: deltamethrin was determined. Anopheles arabiensis sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) mosquitoes were further genotyped for L1014S and L1014F kdr mutation by real time PCR. An allele frequency of 1.33% for L1014S with no L1014F was detected. To evaluate the implication of pyrethroid resistance on malaria transmission, Plasmodium falciparum enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and further, the behaviour of the vectors was assessed by comparing indoor and outdoor proportions of mosquitoes collected. Sporozoite infection rate was observed at 4.94 and 2.60% in funestusAn. gambiae corresponded with high Plasmodium Conclusions: in An. gambiae investigate other mechanisms of resistance. Despite being susceptible to pyrethroids malaria infections in the area. Keywords: Background In the last decade, there have been global efforts to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality through different programmes [1]. In Kenya, the main strategies employed by the National Malaria Control Programme have been: (1) scaling up of vector control interventions; (2) timely diagnosis and effective treatment using artemisininbased combination therapy (ACT); and (3) intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTP) [ *Correspondence: dmatoke@kemri.org 5 ‑Centre for Biotechnology Research and Development, Nairobi, Kenya Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Status of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Kwale County, Coastal Kenya</span>

The most common and widespread of these methods is the use of IRS and LLINs, with LLINs being more dominant due to ease of distribution and low cost associated with their roll out [5].Pyrethroids remain the only class of insecticides rec-ommended for the treatment of LLINs. This arises from 2]. For their low toxicity to humans and their mode of action which entails rapid and persistent effects against mosqui-toes [6]. Until an alternative is obtained, vector control using LLINs remains heavily dependent on pyrethroids.Open Access</span>

  <span class="columnSpan">In Kenya, a mass bed net distribution campaign in malaria endemic areas was held in 2006, where LLINs given to pregnant women and children below the age of 5  yyears attained a coverage of 60% [7]. In 2012, a near universal coverage was attained with another mass distri bution of LLINs, where the goal of one net in every two people in a household was reached [8]. This increased ITN coverage coupled to the other malaria control strategies has seen reduction in malaria transmission in many localities. Unfortunately, the sustainability of vector control using LLINs remains questionable due to insecticide resistance. Already the last decade has seen increased reports of resistance to pyrethroids in at least 27 countries in Africa [9]. In Kenya, resistance has been reported in Western Kenya, with no report on the current state of insecticide resistance in the Kenyan Coast despite intensified vector control in the area [10–12]. The main malaria vectors in the Kenyan Coast are; Anopheles funestusAnopheles gambiae13 bers of both complexes exhibit variation in their biology making it difficult to have a universal control. With LLINs targeting malaria vectors biting indoors, the occurrence of resistance could greatly impact malaria transmission dynamics. Changes in species composition, as well as, changes in their role in transmission have been reported in relation to increased bed-net use and cover age [14, 15]. With the increased use of pyrethroids for LLINs, IRS and in agriculture mosquitoes are subjected to insecticide pressure thereby, increasing their probability of resistance [16]. In the light of the increased bed-net coverage and the likelihood of this serving as a potential selective pressure for malaria vectors, this study sort to assess the level of phenotypic and genotypic resistance in Kwale County in the Kenyan Coast. In an effort to understand the impli cation of resistance on malaria transmission, species composition, sporozoite infection and indoor/outdoor proportions of malaria vectors was assessed. Study area The study was conducted in South Coast Kenya in Kwale County. The study area has been previously described [17]. Anopheles funestusAn. gambiae main malaria vectors in the area [18, 19]. They occur all year round, with peak season during the rainy sea son [18]. In the area, 50% of households have universal ITN coverage (≤  22 persons per ITN). Generally, for the Kenyan Coast an increase in malaria prevalence from 4 to 8% since 2010 has been reported. Sampling was done Methods</span>

The history of bed net use in Kidomaya dates back to 1998 where all households were provided -with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) as part of a clinical trial [20]. After this, the two villages have received par-allel distribution of LLINs through the National Malaria Control Programme by mass distribution campaigns held in 2006 and 2012.Mosquitoes were collected in July and August 2015, which corresponds to the dry season. Adult mosqui-toes were collected using light traps, which have been reported to be efficient in collecting host-seeking mos-quitoes [19]. Additionally, Light traps were supplemented with Prokopack aspirator (John W. Hock Co., Gainesville, FL, USA) to capture indoor resting mosquitoes.In each trapping night, light traps were set up both ]. Mem-inside and outside three randomly selected houses in each village between 1800 and 1700  hh. Indoor traps were set up at the foot side of the bed 1  mm off the ground and approximately 1.5  mm from the place of sleep [21]. The outdoor traps were placed at least 5  mm from houses con-taining the indoor light traps. The traps were removed the following morning between 0600 and 0700  hh. To -boost the number of blood-fed mosquitoes collected, aspiration was done in the same and nearby houses within 500  mm radius in the morning between 0700 and 0900  hh using Prokopack aspirator with a view of maxi-mum sampling. Live mosquitoes collected by light traps and aspirators were transferred into paper cups, provided with 6% sucrose and stored in a cool box for transporta-tion to Msambweni Hospital Research laboratory for fur-ther processing.-Adult mosquitoes collected were sorted according to their sex and physiological status i.e. as gravid, half gravid, blood fed and unfed. Live mosquitoes that were gravid, half gravid and blood-fed were kept in paper cups in the insectary. They were provided with 6% sucrose, when fully gravid they were transferred to individual egg laying tubes. The egg laying tubes were perforated 1.5  mml eppendorf tubes lined with a moistened strip of filter paper [22]. Eggs from individual females were reared in separate trays to obtain iso-female families.Larvae collection was done in all identified water bod--ies in each village. Approximately five larval habitats were sampled in each village per week. Initially, larvae were collected using the standard dipping method whereby, ten dips were made per potential larval habitat using a standard 350  mml dipper [23]. As the densities of Anoph-</span>

Anopheles were placed in holding tubes for 1  hh after which any moribund mosquito was removed before being transferred to exposure tubes lined with insecticide or silicone oil impregnated papers. The tubes were held in vertical position and the knockdown rate recorded at intervals of 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60  mmin. After 60  mmin the mos quitoes were transferred to holding tubes, maintained on 6% glucose and mortality rate determined 24 exposure. Laboratory reared An. gambiae (s.s.) Kisumu strain were exposed to each insecticide as positive control while 20–25 field collected adults were exposed to control papers as negative control and used in correcting mortality rate using the Abbotts’s formula [24]. Mortality rate was calculated by expressing the total number of dead mosquitoes from all four replicates for an individual insecticide as a percentage of the total exposed. Filed collected adults and adults emerging from field collected larvae were identified morphologically to species level [25] and preserved on silica gel granules at room temperature. The field collected adults were later dissected into three portions; (1) head and thorax, (2) legs and wings, and (3) abdomen. For field collected adults, genomic DNA was extracted from the legs and wings. The other body sections were used for other analysis such as sporozoite ELISA analysis. For adults emerging from field collected larvae, genomic DNA was extracted from the whole body, and subjected to species ID and KDR analysis [26]. The DNA was used for sub-species identi
